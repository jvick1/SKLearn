This assignment has two major parts:

Part 1 - Use the Linear Regression object and the Boston Housing toy data set. Create a linear model that relates the various factors in the dataset to the price of housing in Boston. Then, report which factor seems to have the most influence (positive or negative) upon the price of a house. Note: we are not interested in correlation coefficient or any measure of fitness. We only want the impact of any one factor in isolation.

Part 2 - Use the kmeans clustering algorithm and either the wine or the iris data set. In each case, the data source suggests that the data represents 3 distinct groups or varieties. Using the average distance between the centroids and the data points and the Elbow Heuristic, confirm or reject that 3 is the correct number of groups for this data set. Display the graph you cite as evidence.
